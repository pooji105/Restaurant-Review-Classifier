# 🍽️ Restaurant Review Classifier Using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
The *Restaurant Review Classifier* is an AI-based sentiment analysis system that categorizes restaurant feedback into **Positive** or **Negative** sentiments. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the model analyzes customer opinions and highlights the service aspects they frequently mention, such as **food quality, staff behavior, hygiene, pricing, and ambience**. This project aids restaurant businesses in understanding customer satisfaction and improving decision-making.

## 🧠 Technical Workflow
1. **Dataset Acquisition** – Restaurant feedback dataset containing labeled sentiment values.
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Cleaning, tokenizing, removing stopwords, and stemming using NLTK.
3. **Feature Extraction** – Transformation into numerical data using TF-IDF.
4. **Model Training** – Trained multiple ML models and selected the best-performing algorithm.
5. **Deployment** – Integrated the model into a Flask web application for real-time sentiment prediction.
